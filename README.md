# General-Purpose-Heap
This project implements a generic GeneralPurposeHeap class in Java, which can be used to manage heap-based data structures like min-heaps. The project also includes two supporting classes: MoltDriver and MoltOrder, which represent drivers and orders respectively in a delivery system.
